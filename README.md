# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

My deployed website (I used the stencil) would be https://tiredkitty147.github.io/development/

### Goal and Value of the Application

The application I created is an interface that includes a list of items of a bakery for purchase and a favorites list that totals the price of the favorite items. It is an interface for users to select items out of the bakery's list. The theme of my application is a Turkish bakery and there is an aggregator that totals the price of the favorite items. The goal of my application is to filter and sort the items using the sidebar, to add items to the favorites list, or to remove items from the favorites list. The filtering/sorting helps users reduce the number of options by 'Type' or 'Dietary Restriction' of the item.

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
